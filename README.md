The assets are GPL'd. I don't really care what you do with the code (commercial use, noncommercial use, really I don't care), but it's being distributed with GPL assets, which I think makes the code GPL? I'm not sure. Maybe if you deleted all the TAM textures and made your own you'll be fine. #licenseover
